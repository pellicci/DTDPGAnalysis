A more detailed description might follow in the future. For the time
being this directory contains only the following three files:

* MonsterEventsInspector.[h,C]: Holds the description and
  implementation of class that provides the functionallity to 
  + read a ROOT file storing the instantaneous luminosity at certain
    intervals with the information on which fill it was produced
  + read and store the monster events from a text file
  + Correlate both informations

* RunTest.C: Implements a ROOT macro that uses the previous class to
  read the monster events and, by iterating over them, construct a few
  interesting histograms.

All files are quite commented. Please contact Isidro Gonzalez
Caballero if you have questions on this code.
